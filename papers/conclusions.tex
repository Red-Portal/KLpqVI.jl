\section{Conclusions}
In this work, we studied the properties of Markovian score climbing (MSC) with independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) type Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) kernels.
We showed that, IMH type kernels are able to automatically perform bias-variance tradeoff using their accept-reject mechanism.
We also discussed a limitation of the conditional importance sampling (CIS) kernel originally used in MSC.
We proposed parallel IMH (PIMH) as an alternative to the CIS kernel that enjoys the benefits of CIS except its limitations.
Our experiment show that, MSC combined with PIMH performs well on the considered Bayesian inference problems, even compared to exclusive variational inference methods.

%An interesting direction for future research would be to invstigate whether such result 
%This is against the conclusions of~\citet{dhaka_challenges_2021} that exclusive VI should outperform inclusive VI in high-dimensions.
