\section{Conclusions}
In this work, we studied the properties of Markovian score climbing (MSC) with independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) type of Markov-chain Monte Carlo kernels.
We showed that IMH type kernels are able to automatically perform bias-variance trade-off using their accept-reject mechanism.
We also discovered a limitation of the conditional importance sampling (CIS) kernel originally used in MSC.
We proposed parallel IMH (PIMH) as an alternative to the CIS kernel that enjoys the benefits of CIS except its limitations.
Our experiment show that PIMH performs well on multiple inference problems.
