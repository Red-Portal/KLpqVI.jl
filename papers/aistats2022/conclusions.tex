\section{Conclusions}
\vspace{-0.08in}
In this paper, we investigated the properties of Markovian score climbing (MSC) with independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) type Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) kernels.
We proved that IMH type kernels are able to automatically perform bias-variance tradeoff using their accept-reject mechanism.
We also analyzed the limitation of the conditional importance sampling (CIS) kernel originally used in MSC.
We then proposed parallel IMH (PIMH) as an alternative that enjoys the benefits of CIS without its limitations.
Our experiments verify that MSC combined with PIMH performs well on the considered Bayesian inference problems, even compared to exclusive variational inference methods.

%An interesting direction for future research would be to invstigate whether such result 
%This is against the conclusions of~\citet{dhaka_challenges_2021} that exclusive VI should outperform inclusive VI in high-dimensions.
