\paragraph{Did inclusive VI live up to its hype?}
\citet{dhaka_challenges_2021} showed that, inclusive VI works against our intuitions in higher dimensions.
However, if the posterior is strongly correlated, inclusive VI can fail even in lower dimensions.
On the other hand, if the posterior is not strongly correlated, our experiments suggest that inclusive VI can work better than exclusive VI.
Furthermore, posterior correlation affects all methods relying on the mean-field approximation, not only inclusive VI.

%A practical question would be to ask how correlated are problems encountered in practice
