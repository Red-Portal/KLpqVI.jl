\subsection{Inclusive Variational Inference Until Now}\label{section:ivi_previous}
A typical way to perform VI is to use stochastic gradient descent (SGD,~\citealt{robbins_stochastic_1951}), which requires unbiased gradient estimates of the optimization target.
In the case of inclusive variational inference, this corresponds to 
%
\begin{align}
  \nabla_{\vlambda} \DKL{p}{q_{\lambda}}
  = \Esub{p(\vz\mid\vx)}{ - \nabla_{\vlambda} \log q_{\vlambda}(\vz) }
  = - \Esub{p(\vz\mid\vx)}{ s\,(\vz; \vlambda) }
\end{align}
where \(s\,(\vz; \vlambda) = \nabla_{\vlambda} \log q_{\vlambda}(\vz)\) is known as the \textit{score function}.
Estimating the gradient requires integrating the score function over \(p(\vz\mid\vx)\).

\paragraph{Importance Sampling}
If samples from the variational approximation \(q_{\lambda}\) are easy to obtain, a simple solution is to use importance sampling (IS, \citealt{robert_monte_2004, mcbook}) since 
\begin{align}
  \Esub{p(\vz\mid\vx)}{ s\,(\vz; \vlambda) }
  \propto \sum_{\vz \sim q_{\lambda}(\vz)} \frac{p\,(\vz,\vx)}{q_{\vlambda}(\vz)} \, s\,(\vz; \vlambda)
  = \sum_{\vz \sim q_{\lambda}(\vz)} w\,(\vz) \, s\,(\vz; \vlambda).
\end{align}
where \(w\,(\vz) = p\,(\vz,\vx) / q_{\vlambda}(\vz)\) is known as the \textit{importance weight}.
This scheme is equivalent to adaptive IS methods~\citep{cappe_adaptive_2008, bugallo_adaptive_2017} where the IS proposal \(q_{\vlambda}\) is iteratively optimized based on the current samples.
While IS is unbiased, it is remarkably unstable in practice.
Using the \textit{normalized weight} \(\widetilde{w}^{(i)} = \nicefrac{w\,(\vz^{(i)})}{\sum_{i=1}^N w\,(\vz^{(i)}) }\) instead results in the self-normalized IS (SNIS) approximation, which is often much more stable.
However, SNIS still fails to converge even on moderate dimensional objectives, and unlike IS, it is no longer unbiased~\citep{robert_monte_2004, mcbook}.

\paragraph{Description of MSC}
Recently,~\citet{NEURIPS2020_b2070693} proposed \textit{markovian score climbing} (MSC) for performing inclusive VI.
They showed that MSC achieves better and robust performance compared to methods such as SNIS and expectation propagation (EP, \citealt{10.5555/2074022.2074067})
The pseudocode is presented in Algorithm~\ref{alg:msc}.
MSC obtains stochastic gradients from a Markov-chain \(\{\,\vz_1, \vz_2, \ldots \vz_T\,\}\) generated from a \(\pi\)-invariant transition operator \(K(\vz, \cdot)\) running in parallel with the VI optimizer (represented by the sequence \(\{\,\vlambda_1, \vlambda_2, \ldots, \vlambda_T\,\}\)).
%If \(K(\vz, \cdot)\) is a proper Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) kernel,~\citeauthor{NEURIPS2020_b2070693} note that the gradient estimates become asymptotically unbiased with \(t \rightarrow \infty\).

\paragraph{A Motivating Mystery}
Despite the fact that~\citeauthor{NEURIPS2020_b2070693} suggested that MSC works well because of the good quality of the MCMC generated gradients, we present an example that begs for an alternative explanation.
%(asymptotic) unbiasedness is what makes MSC work well in practice, we present an example that motivates an alternative explanation.
In particular, when using the CIS kernel, our example suggests that \textit{MSC makes the most progress when the Markov-chain is the least effective}.
In Figure~\ref{fig:motivating}, we show the trace plot of \(\vz_t\) (\textcolor{blue}{blue line}) and noisy estimates of \(\DKL{p}{q_{\vlambda}}\) (\textcolor{red}{red line}).
Notice that \(\vz_t\) barely moves until iteration 300, where \(\DKL{p}{q_{\vlambda}}\) starts to converge.
In a traditional accept-reject MCMC kernel, this corresponds to most of the samples being rejected, which says that the kernel is statistically very ineffective, at least in a conventional understanding of MCMC.

%We later show that this phenomenon is actually 
%Thus, until we achieve convergence, the samples from \(K(\vz_{t-1}, \cdot)\) are the most biased towards the previous state \(\vz_{t-1}\).
%In this work, we show that this counter-intuitive behavior of the CIS kernel is what makes MSC work well in practice.
