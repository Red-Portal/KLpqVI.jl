\subsection{Connections with Adaptive Markov-chain Monte Carlo}
\citet{10.1007/s11222-008-9110-y, garthwaite_adaptive_2016} discuss the use of stochastic approximation in adaptive MCMC.
The containment condition is known to generally hold in practice~\citep{rosenthal_optimal_, article}.
Thus, recent works on adaptive MCMC have mainly focused on enforcing the diminishing adaptation condition~\citep{wang_adaptive_2013}.
In the context of MSC, the diminishing adaptation condition is statisfied by using a stepsize schedule such that \(\gamma_k \rightarrow 0\).
Thus, it should be possible to treat \(\vz^{(i)}_t\) as genuine samples from the posterior.
